Rob Dougherty - CEO, White Wizard Games | <b>Docking</b> If a ship returns to your hand with docking, it does so AFTER you draw your hand, so you will end your turn with an extra card in hand. <b>Midgate Station</b> If you discard 0 cards with its primary ability, you choose to gain 1 Trade or Combat. <b>“Scrap this card” ally abilities</b> Like any ally abilities, these trigger when you have another card of their faction in play, but you choose if and when to use this ability once it has been triggered. So, if you don’t want to scrap the card, just don’t use the ally ability. <b>Powerful Backing</b> The player currently taking their turn counts as having two extra cards of each faction in play that turn for triggering their ally and double ally abilities. <b>Patience Rewarded</b> Like with all cards where each player makes a choice, start with the player currently taking their turn and proceed clockwise.",
